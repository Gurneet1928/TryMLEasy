Possible Improvements in this project (Feel free to suggest more ):

>> Overall Improvements
---- Better Themes
---- Better Caching and performance
---- Improved Graphs wherevere required, with appropriate size 
---- Maybe a final page to test any manual input values against the model

>> Main Page / Dataset Upload
---- Saving the uploaded file in the session_state for long. In case the user comes back to main page, the uploaded dataset is always retained.

>> Show Dataset
---- Options to show dataset feature properties (like datatype, unique and total values, missing/NaN/Null values)
---- Options to clean the dataset using various methods (dropna, fillna)

>> Feature Selection
---- More Preprocessing Techniques
---- Encoding methods (like OneHot), bucketization methods

>> Model Selection
---- Nothing much, maybe something like Small Icon/Image with Button can be good

>> Neural Network Configuration
---- More Activation Functions
---- Fixing the index issue (possibly from the side of streamlit)
---- More Layer Types (Dense, Dropout, Normalization, etc.)
---- Better naming for layers

>> Neural Network Architecture
---- Saving the optimizer (since it does not save with the model)
---- Better Table View for model.summary() 
---- More optimizer, loss and metric options 

>> Neural Network Training
---- Better Epoch Outputs in format of tables
